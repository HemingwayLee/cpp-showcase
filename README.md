## gcc vs make
* `gcc` is a C compiler
  * It compiles and/or links a single file
  * It does not knows how to combine several source files into a running program
* `make` is a build automation tool that invokes the compiler (which could be gcc) in a particular sequence to compile multiple sources and link them together
  * It automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called `Makefiles` which specify how to derive the target program
  * `make` is useful for controlling the build process of a project
  * It also tracks dependencies between various source files and object files that result from compilation of sources

## gcc vs g++
* `gcc` is for C
* `g++` is for Cpp
